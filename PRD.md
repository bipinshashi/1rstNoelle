Your goal is to come up with a UI design for a business website of a real estate firm 1rstNoelle that showcases its property portfolios. The business mainly focusses on fix and flips, so make sure to have a way to highlight before and after pics. 
Break down the different pages first. And note down the main user stories within each page and add them to a file called user-stories.md

Consult user-stories.md and design a one page html website using design principles from prd/design-system.json.
